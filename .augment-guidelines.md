## Naming Conventions

To maintain consistency and readability, please follow these naming conventions:

### File and Directory Naming

- **Files**: Use camelCase and add suffixes where appropriate.
  - Examples: `creatureGenerator.ts`, `mutationService.ts`, `particleVertex.glsl`

- **Directories**: Use lowercase and be descriptive.
  - Examples: `services`, `types`, `workers`, `traits`

### Code Element Naming

- **Classes**: Use PascalCase and suffixes for clarity.
  - Examples: `CreatureGenerator`, `MutationService`, `InstancedRenderer`

- **Interfaces**: Use PascalCase without 'I' prefix.
  - Examples: `Ability`, `Formation`, `RenderOptions`

- **Types**: Use PascalCase.
  - Examples: `AbilityType`, `FormationPattern`, `RenderMode`

- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
  - Examples: `MAX_PARTICLES`, `DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE`

- **Functions**: Use camelCase with verb-noun structure.
  - Examples: `generateCreature()`, `applyMutation()`, `renderParticles()`

- **Variables**: Use camelCase and be descriptive.
  - Examples: `particleCount`, `currentFormation`, `blockNonce`

- **Enums**: Use PascalCase for names and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for values.
  - Examples: `Role.CORE`, `Rarity.LEGENDARY`

### Domain-Specific Naming

- **Domain Entities**: Use PascalCase.
  - Examples: `Creature`, `ParticleGroup`, `Ability`

- **Domain Services**: Use PascalCase with 'Service' suffix.
  - Examples: `MutationService`, `EvolutionService`, `BitcoinService`

- **Bank Loaders**: Use PascalCase with 'BankLoader' suffix.
  - Examples: `TraitBankLoader`, `AbilityBankLoader`

  - Examples: `InstancedRenderer`, `ParticleRenderer`

- **Workers**: Use PascalCase with 'Worker' suffix.
  - Examples: `PhysicsWorker`, `BehaviorWorker`

- **Game Theory Components**: Use PascalCase and be descriptive.
  - Examples: `PayoffMatrix`, `StrategyProfile`, `NashEquilibrium`

## Dependencies

To maintain a clean and manageable codebase, follow these dependency rules:

- **Types**: Type definitions in `src/types/` are the foundation and can be imported by services, libraries, and workers.
- **Services**: Services should import types and libraries but not other services directly. Cross-service communication should be via events or initialization methods.
- **Libraries**: Libraries are self-contained and can import types but not services.
- **Workers**: Workers import types and shared utilities, communicating via message passing.

When adding new components, ensure that you follow the established import chains and avoid circular dependencies by using interfaces, event-based communication, or dependency injection.

## Types

All type definitions are located in `src/types部分types/`. When adding new features, use the existing types where possible. If new types are needed, define them in the appropriate subdirectory within `src/types/`, following the naming conventions.

Ensure that types are properly exported and imported where needed, maintaining the dependency flow.

## Framework and Architecture

The project follows a domain-driven design with a focus on separation of concerns. Key architectural patterns include:

- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Business logic is encapsulated in services located in `src/services/`.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Services are accessed via singleton instances using `get[ServiceName]()` functions.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Cross-domain interactions are managed through an event bus to decouple components.
- **Web Workers**: Computationally intensive tasks are offloaded to web workers to maintain performance.

When extending the project, ensure that new components adhere to these patterns.

## Key Systems

The project includes several key systems that you may need to interact with:

- **Particle System**: Manages particle groups and their behaviors. Refer to `src/services/rendering/particleRenderer.ts` and related documentation.
- **Evolution System**: Handles creature evolution and mutations. See `src/services/evolution/evolutionService.ts`.
- **Game Theory System**: Implements game theory mechanics. Check `src/services/gameTheory/payoffMatrixService.ts`.

When working with these systems, follow the existing patterns and ensure that any modifications or extensions maintain the integrity of the system.

## Evolution System Guidelines

### Evolution Tracking
The evolution system must:
- Track both chance-based and guaranteed mutation opportunities
- Store evolution history in `localStorage`
- Maintain deterministic evolution paths
- Preserve creature identity through mutations

### Implementation Requirements
1. **Milestone Checking**:
   ```typescript
   const evolutionTracker = getEvolutionTracker();
   const milestone = evolutionTracker.checkMilestone(blockData.confirmations);
   ```

2. **Mutation Application**:
   ```typescript
   if (milestone.guaranteed) {
     evolutionTracker.applyGuaranteedMutation(creature, milestone.rarityWeights, evolutionStream);
   } else if (evolutionTracker.shouldMutate(milestone.chance, evolutionStream)) {
     evolutionTracker.applyMutation(creature, milestone.rarityTiers, evolutionStream);
   }
   ```

## Bitcoin Integration Guidelines

### Data Flow Requirements
1. **Block Data Fetching**:
   - Single API call per block number
   - Use relative paths only
   - Extract only nonce and confirmations

2. **RNG Seeding**:
   - Use block nonce as exclusive RNG seed
   - Implement mulberry32 for deterministic generation

3. **Evolution Triggers**:
   - Check confirmations against milestone thresholds
   - Apply appropriate mutation chances or guarantees
   - Maintain evolution history

#### Guidelines Breakdown
The `.augment-guidelines.md` is structured to address the user’s requirements for maintaining structure, naming conventions, dependencies, types, framework, and architecture. Below is a detailed explanation of each section, including relevant tables from the documentation.

##### Directory Structure
The project’s directory structure is designed for clarity and scalability, with 15 root directories and 9 root files. The augment bot must place new files in the appropriate directories based on their function. Key directories include:

| **Directory** | **Purpose** | **Subdirectories/Files** |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `src/` | Source code | `types/`, `services/`, `lib/`, `data/`, `models/`, `utils/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `contexts/`, `pages/`, `styles/`, `constants/`, `workers/`, `index.ts` |
| `traits/` | Trait definitions | `abilities/`, `formations/`, `behaviors/`, `visuals/`, `mutations/`, `index.ts` |
| `docs/` | Documentation | `project_overview.md`, `trait_system.md`, `architecture/`, `api/`, `guides/`, `implementation/` |

| `config/` | Configuration files | `default.json`, `development.json`, `test.json`, `production.json`, `webpack/`, `jest/`, `eslint/`, `typescript/`, `app/`, `env/` |
| `assets/` | Static assets | `images/`, `sounds/`, `shaders/`, `models/`, `fonts/`, `textures/`, `animations/` |
| `public/` | Public files | `index.html`, `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, `robots.txt`, `images/`, `static/`, `locales/` |

**Guideline**: New features should be placed in the relevant directory (e.g., new services in `src/services/`, new types in `src/types/`). This maintains the project’s organizational integrity.

##### Naming Conventions
The naming conventions ensure a clean and understandable codebase. The augment bot must follow these rules for all new code elements:

| **Category** | **Convention** | **Examples** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Files** | camelCase, add suffixes | `creatureGenerator.ts`, `mutationService.ts`, `particleVertex.glsl` |
| **Directories** | lowercase, descriptive | `services`, `types`, `workers`, `traits` |
| **Classes** | PascalCase, use suffixes | `CreatureGenerator`, `MutationService`, `InstancedRenderer` |
| **Interfaces** | PascalCase, no "I" prefix | `Ability`, `Formation`, `RenderOptions` |
| **Types** | PascalCase | `AbilityType`, `FormationPattern`, `MutationEffect` |
| **Constants** | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_PARTICLES`, `DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE` |
| **Functions** | camelCase, verb-noun | `generateCreature()`, `applyMutation()`, `renderParticles()` |
| **Variables** | camelCase, descriptive | `particleCount`, `currentFormation`, `mutationChance` |
| **Enums** | PascalCase name, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE values | `Role.CORE`, `Rarity.LEGENDARY` |

**Domain-Specific Naming**:
- **Entities**: `Creature`, `ParticleGroup`, `Ability`
- **Services**: `MutationService`, `EvolutionService`, `BitcoinService`
- **Bank Loaders**: `TraitBankLoader`, `AbilityBankLoader`
- **Renderers**: `InstancedRenderer`, `ParticleRenderer`
- **Workers**: `PhysicsWorker`, `BehaviorWorker`
- **Game Theory**: `PayoffMatrix`, `StrategyProfile`, `NashEquilibrium`

**Consistency Rules**:
1. Be consistent across the codebase.
2. Use descriptive, concise names.
3. Follow domain language (e.g., “Creature” for entities).
4. Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood.
5. Use singular for types (e.g., `Ability`), plural for collections (e.g., `abilities`).

**Guideline**: Apply these conventions to all new files, directories, and code elements to ensure readability and maintainability.

##### Dependencies
The dependency map outlines how types, services, libraries, and workers interact, with rules to prevent circular dependencies:

| **Category** | **Rules** | **Examples** |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Types** | `core.ts` has no imports; domain files import from `core.ts`; limited cross-imports | `import { Role } from '../../types/core';` |
| **Services** | Singleton pattern with `get[ServiceName]()`; import types and libraries, not other services; use events or `initialize()` for cross-domain | `import { getTraitBankLoader } from './traitBankLoader';` |
| **Libraries** | Self-contained; import types, not services; no circular dependencies | `import { Vector3 } from '../../types/core';` |
| **Workers** | Import types and shared utilities; communicate via message passing | `import { PhysicsData } from '../../types/workers/physics';` |

**Dependency Flow**: Types → (Libraries ← Services → Workers) → Application

**Initialization Order**:
1. Core libraries (RNG, event bus)
2. Bitcoin service
3. Trait, formation, behavior, ability services
4. Mutation service
5. Evolution service
6. Rendering services
7. Workers

**Avoiding Circular Dependencies**:
- Use interfaces.
- Implement event-based communication.
- Pass dependencies via `initialize()`.
- Maintain clear domain boundaries.
- Apply dependency injection.

**Guideline**: Follow the dependency flow and initialization order when adding new components. Use event-driven communication and interfaces to manage cross-service interactions.

##### Types
Type definitions reside in `src/types/`, covering core, trait, ability, formation, behavior, mutation, creature, bitcoin, rng, rendering, game theory, and workers. The augment bot should:
- Use existing types where applicable.
- Define new types in `src/types/` subdirectories, following PascalCase naming.
- Ensure proper exports and imports to maintain dependency flow.

**Guideline**: Leverage TypeScript’s type safety by reusing and extending types in `src/types/`, adhering to naming conventions.

##### Framework and Architecture
The project employs a domain-driven design with several architectural patterns:
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Business logic is encapsulated in `src/services/`.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Services are accessed via `get[ServiceName]()` functions.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: An event bus decouples cross-domain interactions.
- **Web Workers**: Heavy computations are offloaded to `src/workers/` for performance.

**Guideline**: New components should follow these patterns, encapsulating logic in services, using singletons, communicating via events, and leveraging Web Workers for intensive tasks.

##### Key Systems
The project includes specialized systems that the augment bot may interact with:

| **System** | **Description** | **Key Files** |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Particle System** | Manages particle groups and behaviors | `src/services/rendering/particleRenderer.ts` |
| **Evolution System** | Handles creature evolution and mutations | `src/services/evolution/evolutionService.ts` |
| **Game Theory System** | Implements game theory mechanics | `src/services/gameTheory/payoffMatrixService.ts` |

**Guideline**: When modifying these systems, follow existing patterns and consult related documentation to maintain system integrity.

##### Using Documentation
The `docs/` directory contains extensive documentation, with key files including:

| **Document** | **Purpose** | **Location** |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Project Overview | High-level project goals and architecture | `@docs/project_overview.md` |
| Directory Structure | Folder organization details | `@docs/directory_structure.md` |
| Dependency Map | Import/export relationships | `@docs/dependency_map.md` |
| Naming Conventions | Naming rules for code elements | `@docs/naming_conventions.md` |
| Implementation Checklist | Development tasks and status | `@docs/project_checklist.md` |

Additional resources are in `docs/architecture/` (diagrams) and `docs/guides/` (development guides).

**Guideline**: Reference these documents for detailed guidance, especially when adding new features or resolving ambiguities.

#### Limitations and Considerations
While the guidelines are comprehensive, they rely on excerpts from key documentation. Additional files, such as `trait_system.md` or `architecture/overview.md`, may provide deeper insights into specific systems. The augment bot should cross-reference these documents when implementing complex features. Furthermore, the guidelines assume the bot can interpret and apply TypeScript and domain-driven design principles effectively.

#### Conclusion
The `.augment-guidelines.md` provides a robust framework for an augment bot to contribute to the Bitcoin Protozoa project while maintaining its structure, naming conventions, dependencies, types, framework, and architecture. By adhering to these guidelines, the bot can ensure consistent, high-quality contributions that align with the project’s standards.
