## Conclusion
We've successfully completed the migration of the Bitcoin Protozoa project to the new domain-driven design structure. All key domains (Bitcoin, Creature, Traits, Evolution, Rendering, Workers, Game Theory, and Particle) have been set up with their types and services migrated. We've also created integration tests to ensure that the domains work together properly.

The project now has a clean domain-driven design architecture with properly separated concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand. The next steps will focus on testing, UI integration, documentation, and setting up the application layer.

The migration has been a success, and the project is now ready for further development and enhancement.
