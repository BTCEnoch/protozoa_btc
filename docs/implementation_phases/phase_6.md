# Phase 6: Testing and Optimization

## Purpose
This document outlines the sixth phase of the Bitcoin Protozoa project, focusing on comprehensive testing and performance optimization to ensure the simulation meets its functional and performance goals. This phase is critical for validating the integration of all systems and ensuring the project is ready for deployment.

## Location
`docs/implementation_phases/phase_6.md`

## Overview
Phase 6 involves two primary objectives:
1. **Testing**:
   - Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to validate functionality, determinism, and user interactions.
   - Ensure all systems work cohesively and meet the project's requirements.
2. **Optimization**:
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks in rendering, physics, and data storage.
   - Implement optimizations to achieve 60 FPS and meet latency targets (e.g., RNG calls <1ms, physics updates <5ms).

This phase also includes updating documentation to reflect testing results and optimization strategies, ensuring the project is thoroughly validated and performant.

## Checklist
- [ ] **Develop Testing Plan**:
  - Outline unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all systems (e.g., RNG, physics, traits, game theory).
  - Include tests for determinism (same inputs produce same outputs) and performance (meet latency targets).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Testing plan documented and approved.
- [ ] **Implement Unit Tests**:
  - Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., `rngSystem.ts`, `particleService.ts`).
  - Ensure >80% code coverage and passing tests.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: All unit tests pass, coverage report generated.
- [ ] **Implement Integration Tests**:
  - Develop tests for system interactions (e.g., RNG with traits, physics with visualization).
  - Validate data flow and event handling via `eventBus.ts`.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Integration tests pass, system interactions are correct.
- [ ] **Implement End-to-End Tests**:
  - Simulate user scenarios (e.g., creature generation, battle initiation, trait toggling via controller UI).
  - Ensure the entire simulation functions as expected.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: End-to-end tests pass, user flows are validated.
- [ ] **Profile Performance**:
  - Use Chrome DevTools to identify bottlenecks in rendering, physics, and storage.
  - Measure key metrics (e.g., FPS, RNG call times, physics update times).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Performance bottlenecks identified and documented.
- [ ] **Optimize Rendering**:
  - Implement instanced rendering for particles.
  - Use level of detail (LOD) for distant creatures.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Rendering maintains â‰¥60 FPS with 500 particles.
- [ ] **Optimize Physics**:
  - Implement spatial partitioning (e.g., grid-based) for efficient collision detection.
  - Optimize force calculations for role-specific mechanics.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Physics updates for 500 particles <5ms.
- [ ] **Optimize Storage**:
  - Use efficient data structures for creature states.
  - Minimize I/O operations with batch writes to IndexedDB.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Storage operations <10ms.
- [ ] **Update Documentation**:
  - Document testing results, including passed tests and coverage.
  - Outline optimization strategies and performance improvements.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Documentation reflects testing and optimization outcomes.

## Migration Tasks
- [ ] **Migrate Testing Logic from `old_src`**:
  - Identify existing tests in `old_src` (e.g., `old_src/tests/`).
  - Refactor tests to Jest and TypeScript, align with new system structures.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Migrated tests cover core functionality and pass.

## PowerShell Scripts
Scripts are located in `docs/implementation_phases/scripts/phase_6/` and automate testing and optimization tasks.

1. **run_tests.ps1**:
   - **Purpose**: Executes Jest tests and generates coverage reports.
   - **Content**:
     ```powershell
     npm run test -- --coverage
     Write-Host "Tests completed, coverage report generated."
     ```
   - **Execution**: `.\run_tests.ps1`

2. **optimize_performance.ps1**:
   - **Purpose**: Applies predefined optimization patches (e.g., enabling instanced rendering).
   - **Content**:
     ```powershell
     # Example: Patch visualService.ts for instanced rendering
     $file = "src/domains/visualization/services/visualService.ts"
     $content = Get-Content $file
     $content -replace "useStandardRendering()", "useInstancedRendering()" | Set-Content $file
     Write-Host "Applied instanced rendering optimization."
     ```
   - **Execution**: `.\optimize_performance.ps1`

## Dependencies
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing.
- **Chrome DevTools**: For performance profiling.
- **PowerShell**: For script execution.

## Milestones
- All tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) pass with >80% coverage.
- Performance optimizations implemented, achieving 60 FPS and meeting latency targets.
- Documentation updated with testing results and optimization details.
- Systems refined based on test outcomes and performance metrics.

## Example: Performance Profiling
Use Chrome DevTools to profile rendering performance:
1. Open the simulation in Chrome.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open DevTools.
3. Go to the **Performance** tab.
4. Click **Record**, interact with the simulation, then stop recording.
5. Analyze the flame chart for rendering bottlenecks (e.g., excessive draw calls).
6. Optimize by implementing instanced rendering or reducing shader complexity.

This phase ensures the Bitcoin Protozoa simulation is thoroughly tested, optimized for performance, and ready for deployment, with all systems functioning cohesively and meeting the project's standards.
