# Phase 7: Deployment and Documentation

## Purpose
This document outlines the seventh phase of the Bitcoin Protozoa project, focusing on deploying the web application and finalizing all documentation to ensure the project is ready for evaluation and public release. This phase is crucial for showcasing the project’s functionality and ensuring it meets the standards for an A+ grade.

## Location
`docs/implementation_phases/phase_7.md`

## Overview
Phase 7 involves two primary objectives:
1. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the web application to a static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
   - Configure environment variables and API keys for production.
   - Ensure the deployed application is accessible and performs as expected.
2. **Documentation**:
   - Finalize all documentation in `docs/`, ensuring completeness and accuracy.
   - Include user guides, developer documentation, and API references.
   - Prepare presentation materials for academic evaluation.

This phase also includes verifying that all systems are integrated correctly and that the application meets the project's performance and functional requirements.

## Checklist
- [ ] **Prepare for Deployment**:
  - Build the application using `npm run build`.
  - Test the build locally to ensure it functions correctly.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Build succeeds, and the application runs without errors.
- [ ] **Deploy to Hosting Service**:
  - Choose a static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
  - Configure deployment settings, including environment variables (e.g., API keys for `bitcoinService.ts`).
  - Deploy the application and verify accessibility.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Application is live and accessible via a public URL.
- [ ] **Configure Production Settings**:
  - Set up production-specific configurations (e.g., API endpoints, logging levels).
  - Ensure security best practices (e.g., HTTPS, secure API keys).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Production settings are correctly applied and secure.
- [ ] **Finalize Documentation**:
  - Complete all documents in `docs/systems/`, `docs/architecture/`, and `docs/references/`.
  - Ensure all `` tags are filled with appropriate content.
  - Create a user guide for interacting with the simulation and controller UI.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Documentation is comprehensive, accurate, and ready for review.
- [ ] **Prepare Presentation Materials**:
  - Develop slides or a report summarizing the project’s goals, architecture, and achievements.
  - Highlight key features, such as deterministic RNG, trait systems, and the controller UI.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Presentation materials are complete and effectively communicate the project’s value.
- [ ] **Conduct Final Testing**:
  - Perform a final round of end-to-end testing to ensure all systems work together seamlessly.
  - Verify performance metrics (e.g., 60 FPS, <1ms RNG calls).
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: All tests pass, and performance targets are met.

## Migration Tasks
- [ ] **Migrate Deployment Scripts from `old_src`**:
  - Identify any deployment-related scripts or configurations in `old_src`.
  - Refactor and update them for the new deployment process.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Deployment scripts are functional and aligned with the new hosting setup.

## Documentation References
- `docs/architecture/deployment_and_maintenance.md`: Guides deployment and production configuration.
- `docs/references/user_flows.md`: Provides context for user guide creation.
- All `docs/systems/*` and `docs/references/*`: Ensure documentation is complete and accurate.

## PowerShell Scripts
Scripts are located in `docs/implementation_phases/scripts/phase_7/` and automate deployment and documentation tasks.

1. **deploy_app.ps1**:
   - **Purpose**: Builds and deploys the application to Vercel.
   - **Content**:
     ```powershell
     npm run build
     vercel deploy --prod
     Write-Host "Application deployed to Vercel."
     ```
   - **Execution**: `.\deploy_app.ps1`

2. **finalize_docs.ps1**:
   - **Purpose**: Validates and generates a documentation index.
   - **Content**:
     ```powershell
     # Example: Check for missing  content
     Get-ChildItem -Path "docs/" -Recurse -Filter "*.md" | ForEach-Object {
         $content = Get-Content $_.FullName
         if ($content -match "") {
             Write-Host "Warning: Placeholder found in $($_.FullName)"
         }
     }
     # Generate index
     Set-Content -Path "docs/index.md" -Value "# Documentation Index\n- [Overview](architecture/overview.md)\n- [Systems](systems/)\n- [References](references/)"
     Write-Host "Documentation finalized and index generated."
     ```
   - **Execution**: `.\finalize_docs.ps1`

## Dependencies
- **Vercel CLI**: For deploying to Vercel.
- **npm**: For building the application.
- **PowerShell**: For script execution.

## Milestones
- Application successfully deployed and accessible.
- Documentation complete, with all placeholders replaced and an index generated.
- Presentation materials ready for academic evaluation.
- Final testing confirms all systems are integrated and performant.

## Example: User Guide for Controller UI
The user guide should include instructions for interacting with the simulation:
- **Generating a Creature**: Enter a block nonce in the controller UI to generate a creature.
- **Toggling Traits**: Use the trait toggle buttons to test different traits and observe their effects.
- **Initiating Battles**: Select creatures and click "Start Battle" to simulate a battle and view the outcome.

This phase ensures the Bitcoin Protozoa project is fully deployed, documented, and ready for evaluation, with all systems functioning cohesively and meeting the required performance standards.
