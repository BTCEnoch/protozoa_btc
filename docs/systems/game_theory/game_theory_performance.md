# Game Theory Performance Optimization

## Purpose
This document addresses performance optimization strategies for the game theory system in Bitcoin Protozoa, ensuring efficient strategic calculations for battle simulations and decision-making with up to 500 particles per creature. It serves as a single source of truth for developers, identifying common bottlenecks, providing tailored optimization techniques, and presenting performance metrics specific to the project’s particle-based design, role-specific mechanics (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK), and deterministic RNG tied to Bitcoin block data.

## Common Performance Bottlenecks
The game theory system, handling payoff matrices, decision trees, Nash equilibria, and utility functions, can encounter several performance bottlenecks when processing 500 particles:

1. **Complex Payoff Matrix Calculations**:
   - **Issue**: Iterating over 500 particles to compute role and trait contributions for payoff matrices is computationally intensive.
   - **Impact**: Increases calculation time, potentially exceeding the 10ms target for battle simulations.
2. **Decision Tree Processing**:
   - **Issue**: Evaluating multiple branches for creatures with diverse particle compositions can lead to high CPU usage.
   - **Impact**: Slows down strategic decision-making, affecting real-time gameplay responsiveness.
3. **Nash Equilibrium Computations**:
   - **Issue**: Calculating pure and mixed equilibria for large matrices involves iterative comparisons, scaling poorly with strategy count.
   - **Impact**: Delays battle outcome determination, risking FPS drops below 60.
4. **Main Thread Overload**:
   - **Issue**: Performing game theory calculations on the main thread can block rendering and UI updates.
   - **Impact**: Causes stuttering or dropped frames, degrading user experience.

## Optimization Techniques
To mitigate these bottlenecks, the following techniques are recommended, tailored to Bitcoin Protozoa’s design:

### 1. Aggregate Particle Data
- **Technique**: Summarize particle role counts and trait effects at the creature level to reduce iteration complexity.
- **Implementation**: Precompute role and trait contributions in `payoffMatrixService.ts` before matrix generation.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/gameTheory/services/payoffMatrixService.ts
  class PayoffMatrixService {
    private cacheRoleSummary(creature: ICreature): { [key in Role]: number } {
      return creature.particles.reduce((acc, p) => {
        acc[p.role] = (acc[p.role] || 0) + 1;
        return acc;
      }, {} as { [key in Role]: number });
    }

    generateMatrix(creature1: ICreature, creature2: ICreature): IPayoffMatrix {
      const roles1 = this.cacheRoleSummary(creature1);
      const attackPayoff = roles1[Role.ATTACK] * 0.25; // Aggregate instead of iterating
      // Matrix construction
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Cache Payoff Matrices and Equilibria
- **Technique**: Store frequently used payoff matrices and equilibria in memory to avoid recalculation for common creature matchups.
- **Implementation**: Use a Map in `payoffMatrixService.ts` and `nashEquilibriumFinder.ts` to cache results by creature IDs.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/gameTheory/services/payoffMatrixService.ts
  class PayoffMatrixService {
    private matrixCache: Map<string, IPayoffMatrix> = new Map();

    generateMatrix(creature1: ICreature, creature2: ICreature): IPayoffMatrix {
      const cacheKey = `${creature1.id}_${creature2.id}`;
      if (this.matrixCache.has(cacheKey)) {
        return this.matrixCache.get(cacheKey)!;
      }
      const matrix = this.computeMatrix(creature1, creature2);
      this.matrixCache.set(cacheKey, matrix);
      return matrix;
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Off-Thread Processing
- **Technique**: Delegate complex calculations (e.g., Nash equilibria, decision tree traversal) to Web Workers (`computeWorker.ts`) to offload the main thread.
- **Implementation**: Use `workerBridge.ts` to coordinate worker tasks.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/workers/services/workerBridge.ts
  class WorkerBridge {
    async sendMessage(workerType: string, data: any): Promise<any> {
      const worker = new Worker(`./${workerType}.js`);
      return new Promise(resolve => {
        worker.onmessage = e => resolve(e.data);
        worker.postMessage(data);
      });
    }
  }
  export const workerBridge = new WorkerBridge();
  ```

### 4. Simplify Decision Trees
- **Technique**: Limit the number of branches in decision trees to key strategies (e.g., Attack, Defend) to reduce computational load.
- **Implementation**: Restrict tree depth and breadth in `decisionTreeService.ts`.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/gameTheory/services/decisionTreeService.ts
  class DecisionTreeService {
    constructTree(creature1: ICreature, creature2: ICreature): IDecisionTree {
      return {
        root: {
          type: 'decision',
          branches: [
            { strategy: 'Attack', weight: this.calculateWeight(creature1, 'Attack') },
            { strategy: 'Defend', weight: this.calculateWeight(creature1, 'Defend') }
          ]
        }
      };
    }
  }
  ```

## Performance Metrics
The following metrics guide optimization efforts:
1. **Calculation Time**:
   - **Target**: < 10ms for a battle simulation or decision for 500 particles.
   - **Description**: Measures time for matrix generation, equilibrium calculation, or decision tree processing.
   - **Threshold**: > 20ms indicates a need for optimization.
2. **FPS Impact**:
   - **Target**: Maintain ≥ 60 FPS during game theory calculations.
   - **Description**: Ensures calculations don’t degrade rendering performance.
   - **Threshold**: < 30 FPS signals a critical issue.
3. **CPU Usage**:
   - **Target**: < 20% CPU usage for calculations on a mid-range device.
   - **Description**: Monitors main thread and worker thread load.
   - **Threshold**: > 50% suggests inefficient processing.
4. **Memory Usage**:
   - **Target**: < 5 MB for game theory data and caches.
   - **Description**: Tracks memory for matrices, trees, and equilibria.
   - **Threshold**: > 20 MB risks performance on lower-end devices.

## Benchmark Results

  - Notes: Slightly below FPS target; further optimization may be needed.

## Tools for Measurement
1. **Performance.now()**:
   - Measures calculation times in `gameTheoryStrategyService.ts`.
   - **Example**:
     ```typescript
     const start = performance.now();
     gameTheoryStrategyService.simulateBattle(creature1, creature2);
     console.log(`Battle time: ${performance.now() - start}ms`);
     ```
2. **Three.js Stats Module**:
   - Monitors FPS during rendering, integrated in `sceneManager.ts`.
3. **Chrome DevTools**:
   - Profiles CPU usage and worker thread performance.
4. **Node.js Profiler**:
   - Measures memory usage for game theory data structures.

## Integration Points
- **Game Theory Domain (`src/domains/gameTheory/`)**: Optimizes `payoffMatrixService.ts`, `decisionTreeService.ts`, `nashEquilibriumFinder.ts`, and `utilityFunctionService.ts`.
- **Creature Domain (`src/domains/creature/`)**: Uses `ICreature` and `IParticle` data for calculations.
- **Traits Domain (`src/domains/traits/`)**: Applies `IAbility`, `IBehavior`, and `IMutation` traits to modify outcomes.
- **Workers Domain (`src/domains/workers/`)**: Leverages `computeWorker.ts` for off-thread processing.

## Rules Adherence
- **Determinism**: Calculations use deterministic inputs (e.g., seeded RNG, static traits).
- **Modularity**: Optimization logic is encapsulated in services and workers.
- **Performance**: Targets < 10ms calculations, supporting 60 FPS.

## Migration Steps
To transition from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main):
1. **Identify Existing Logic**: Locate game theory calculation code (e.g., in `src/lib/` or `src/creatures/`).
2. **Refactor into Services**: Move logic to `src/domains/gameTheory/services/` and workers (`computeWorker.ts`).
3. **Implement Optimizations**: Add caching, aggregation, and off-thread processing.
4. **Test Performance**: Measure calculation times and FPS, optimizing bottlenecks using Jest and profiling tools.

## Example Optimization
```typescript
// src/domains/gameTheory/services/nashEquilibriumFinder.ts
class NashEquilibriumFinder {
  private equilibriumCache: Map<string, INashEquilibrium[]> = new Map();

  findEquilibria(matrix: IPayoffMatrix): INashEquilibrium[] {
    const cacheKey = JSON.stringify(matrix.payoffs);
    if (this.equilibriumCache.has(cacheKey)) {
      return this.equilibriumCache.get(cacheKey)!;
    }
    const equilibria = this.computeEquilibria(matrix);
    this.equilibriumCache.set(cacheKey, equilibria);
    return equilibria;
  }
}
```
