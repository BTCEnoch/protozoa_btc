## Introduction to Traits Assignment

In the Bitcoin Protozoa project, traits define the unique characteristics and capabilities of each creature. These traits are categorized into **formations**, **behaviors**, and **abilities**, and are assigned based on a creature's **role**, **class**, **subclass**, and the **ranking of its particle groups**. The assignment process is deterministic, leveraging a Random Number Generator (RNG) system seeded by the Bitcoin block nonce to ensure consistency across all instances of the project.

## Types of Traits

### Formations
- **Definition**: Formations determine the spatial arrangement of a creature's particles, influencing its physical structure and environmental interactions.
- **Examples**: 
  - Shield Line (for Tanks)
  - Zen Circle (for Rogues)
  - Flaming Halo (for Strikers)
- **Assignment**: Based on the dominant particle group and subclass, with complexity and effectiveness scaled by the subclass tier.

### Behaviors
- **Definition**: Behaviors dictate how a creature interacts with its environment and other creatures, such as healing, stunning, or evading.
- **Examples**: 
  - Regenerative Pulse (for Healers)
  - Precision Strike (for Strikers)
  - Evasive Maneuvers (for Rogues)
- **Assignment**: Determined by the creature's role and subclass, with potency influenced by the particle count in the relevant group.

### Abilities
- **Definition**: Abilities are special actions a creature can perform, such as healing allies, dealing damage, or applying crowd control effects.
- **Examples**: 
  - Heal (for Healers)
  - Strike (for Strikers)
  - Shield (for Tanks)
- **Assignment**: Assigned based on the main class and modified by the subclass and particle group rankings.

## Trait Assignment Process

The assignment of traits follows a structured, deterministic process to align each creature's capabilities with its particle group configuration:

1. **Determine Role and Class**:
   - The dominant particle group sets the creature's role and main class (e.g., `CORE` → Healer).
   - The subclass is derived from the ranking of the remaining four groups, with the second-highest group often providing a prefix (e.g., "Guardian" for high `DEFENSE`).

2. **Select Base Traits**:
   - Each main class has a predefined set of base traits tied to its role.
   - Example: A Healer always has a healing ability; a Striker has a damage-dealing ability.

3. **Modify Traits Based on Subclass**:
   - The subclass enhances base traits, adding effects or increasing potency based on secondary particle groups.
   - Example: A Guardian Healer (high `DEFENSE`) might have a Heal ability that also grants a temporary shield.

4. **Scale Traits by Subclass Tier**:
   - The subclass tier, determined by the particle count in the dominant group, scales trait effectiveness.
   - Higher tiers (e.g., Mythic) offer more powerful traits or additional effects.

5. **Apply Deterministic RNG**:
   - The RNG, seeded by the Bitcoin block nonce, selects specific traits from pools for each category (formation, behavior, ability).
   - This ensures consistent trait assignment for a given block nonce, while allowing variation across creatures.

### Example of Trait Assignment
Consider a creature with this particle distribution:
- `CORE`: 150 particles (dominant group)
- `DEFENSE`: 130 particles
- `CONTROL`: 100 particles
- `ATTACK`: 70 particles
- `MOVEMENT`: 50 particles

- **Role and Class**: Healer (from `CORE`)
- **Subclass**: Guardian Healer (from high `DEFENSE`)
- **Subclass Tier**: Legendary (142–151 particles in `CORE`)

**Assigned Traits**:
- **Formation**: Sacred Circle (a defensive formation for Healers, enhanced by Legendary tier)
- **Behavior**: Regenerative Pulse (healing over time, with increased range due to high `CORE`)
- **Ability**: Heal (base ability for Healers), modified by `DEFENSE` to include a shield effect

The RNG, seeded by the block nonce, selects these specific traits from their respective pools, ensuring consistency for this configuration.

## Influence of Particle Group Rankings

Beyond the dominant group, the ranking of particle groups modifies traits:

- **Second-Highest Group (Major Modifier)**: Adds a significant effect (e.g., `DEFENSE` adds shielding to Heal).
- **Third-Highest Group (Secondary Modifier)**: Provides a moderate bonus (e.g., `CONTROL` adds minor crowd control).
- **Fourth-Highest Group (Minor Modifier)**: Offers a small bonus (e.g., `ATTACK` adds slight damage).
- **Fifth-Highest Group (Subtle Perk)**: Grants a minor or conditional bonus (e.g., `MOVEMENT` adds a small speed boost).

This system ensures variety among creatures with similar dominant groups.

## Deterministic RNG in Trait Selection

The RNG system, seeded by the Bitcoin block nonce, ensures consistency:
- **Formation Selection**: Picks a formation from the role- and subclass-specific pool.
- **Behavior Selection**: Chooses a behavior based on role and tier.
- **Ability Modification**: Determines the strength of added effects from secondary groups.

This ties trait assignment to blockchain data, balancing consistency and variety.

## Integration with Evolution

Traits evolve based on confirmation milestones:
- Evolution triggers at specific confirmation counts (e.g., 10k, 50k), with increasing mutation chances.
- Mutations alter or add traits, using the same deterministic RNG process.
- Evolution preserves creature identity while enabling growth.

## Conclusion

The traits assignment process ensures each creature’s formations, behaviors, and abilities reflect its particle group configuration, role, and class. Using a deterministic RNG seeded by the Bitcoin block nonce, the project achieves consistency and balance, while supporting a diverse range of creature characteristics.

### Next Steps

The next document, `integration_with_other_domains.md`, will outline how the Group domain interacts with other domains (e.g., Bitcoin, RNG, Creature, Traits) in the Bitcoin Protozoa project. It will detail dependencies and data flows, ensuring seamless integration within the broader system. This document is queued for production following `traits_assignment.md`.
