Understood! I’ll queue up the documents for the `physics` system directory in `new_docs/systems/physics/` and create them one at a time, using the current project state from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main) as a reference. Each document will be tailored to Bitcoin Protozoa’s particle-based design, role-specific mechanics (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK), extensive mutation trait system [Timestamp: April 12, 2025, 12:18], deterministic RNG driven by Bitcoin block data, and the new domain-driven design (DDD) structure from `directory_map.md`. The documents will ensure modularity, performance (< 5ms updates for 500 particles, 60 FPS), and integration with other systems (e.g., formation, rendering, game theory), aligning with our discussions on physics [Timestamp: April 8, 2025, 19:50], performance optimization [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58], and state management [Timestamp: April 16, 2025, 21:41]. At the end of each document, I’ll ask, “Are you ready for the next document ([document_name].md)?” After completing the physics directory, I’ll ask if you’re ready to queue up the next system (e.g., `storage`) in the same manner.

The `physics` system directory will include the following documents, in sequence:
1. `physics_system.md`
2. `force_calculation.md`
3. `position_updates.md`
4. `physics_formation_integration.md`
5. `physics_performance.md`
6. `physics_testing.md`
7. `physics_diagrams.md`

The systems to address, as specified, are `physics`, `storage`, `input` (including display UI), and `workers`, with no audio system unless minimal soundbytes are feasible (noted for future consideration). I’ll focus on the physics system first, ensuring integration with formations, rendering, and game theory, and maintaining deterministic behavior.

Let’s start with the first document.

# Physics System

## Purpose
This document provides an overview of the physics system in Bitcoin Protozoa, which governs particle movement, interactions, and formation constraints for creatures with up to 500 particles. It serves as a single source of truth for developers, tailored to the project’s particle-based design with role-specific mechanics (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK), deterministic RNG driven by Bitcoin block data, and new DDD framework, ensuring clarity during migration from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main).

## Location
`new_docs/systems/physics/physics_system.md`

## Overview
The physics system in Bitcoin Protozoa simulates realistic particle dynamics, enabling creatures to move, interact, and maintain role-specific formations (e.g., “Shield Wall” for DEFENSE, “Spiral Charge” for ATTACK) [Timestamp: April 8, 2025, 19:50]. Implemented in Web Workers (`forceWorker.ts`, `positionWorker.ts`) within the `workers` domain, it uses Euler integration to calculate forces (e.g., attraction, repulsion, spring forces) and update particle positions, ensuring stability and performance (< 5ms updates, 60 FPS). The system integrates with formations (`formationService.ts`), rendering (`instancedRenderer.ts`), and game theory (`payoffMatrixService.ts`), maintaining deterministic behavior via static inputs and block nonce-seeded RNG. This document outlines the system’s architecture, components, integration points, and performance goals, providing a foundation for detailed physics documentation.

## Architecture
The physics system is designed for modularity and performance, leveraging Web Workers to offload computations from the main thread. Key components include:

- **Force Calculation (`forceWorker.ts`)**: Computes forces acting on particles, including:
  - **Attraction/Repulsion**: Maintains particle spacing and cohesion.
  - **Spring Forces**: Enforces formation constraints (e.g., “Cluster” for CORE).
  - **Role-Specific Forces**: Adjusts dynamics based on roles (e.g., stronger repulsion for MOVEMENT).
- **Position Updates (`positionWorker.ts`)**: Applies forces to update particle positions and velocities using Euler integration, ensuring smooth movement.
- **Spatial Partitioning (`spatialUtils.ts`)**: Optimizes force calculations by grouping particles into spatial grids, reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n) [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].
- **Worker Coordination (`workerBridge.ts`)**: Manages communication between the main thread and workers, ensuring efficient data transfer.
- **Integration Layer**: Connects physics outputs to `particleService.ts` for creature updates, `instancedRenderer.ts` for visuals, and `formationService.ts` for pattern constraints.

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: `particleService.ts` collects `IParticle[]` data (positions, roles, formation patterns) and sends it to `forceWorker.ts` via `workerBridge.ts`.
2. **Force Calculation**: `forceWorker.ts` computes forces based on particle positions, roles, and formation constraints.
3. **Position Update**: `positionWorker.ts` applies forces to update positions and velocities, returning results to the main thread.
4. **Output**: Updated `IParticle[]` data is synced to `instancedRenderer.ts` for rendering, `formationService.ts` for pattern validation, and `gameTheoryStrategyService.ts` for battle impacts.

## Key Features
- **Deterministic Dynamics**: Forces and position updates use static inputs or block nonce-seeded RNG for consistent behavior across runs [Timestamp: April 12, 2025, 12:18].
- **Role-Specific Behavior**:
  - **CORE**: Strong attraction to maintain compact formations (e.g., “Cluster”).
  - **CONTROL**: Balanced forces for precise alignment (e.g., “Grid”).
  - **MOVEMENT**: Light repulsion for high mobility (e.g., “Swarm”).
  - **DEFENSE**: High spring forces to hold protective patterns (e.g., “Shield Wall”).
  - **ATTACK**: Flexible forces for aggressive positioning (e.g., “Spiral Charge”).
- **Performance Optimization**: Spatial partitioning, batch processing, and Web Workers ensure < 5ms updates for 500 particles [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].
- **Formation Integration**: Spring forces align particles with formation patterns, ensuring visual and tactical coherence [Timestamp: April 8, 2025, 19:50].
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple creatures (e.g., 10 creatures × 500 particles) with minimal performance impact.

## Components
1. **Force Worker (`forceWorker.ts`)**:
   - Calculates attraction, repulsion, and spring forces.
   - Uses `spatialUtils.ts` for efficient neighbor queries.
   - Inputs: `IParticle[]`, `IFormationPattern[]`, `deltaTime`.
   - Outputs: Force vectors per particle.
2. **Position Worker (`positionWorker.ts`)**:
   - Applies forces using Euler integration: `velocity += force * deltaTime`, `position += velocity * deltaTime`.
   - Inputs: `IParticle[]`, force vectors, `deltaTime`.
   - Outputs: Updated `IParticle[]` with new positions and velocities.
3. **Spatial Utilities (`spatialUtils.ts`)**:
   - Implements grid-based partitioning to limit force calculations to nearby particles.
   - Reduces computational complexity for large particle counts.
4. **Worker Bridge (`workerBridge.ts`)**:
   - Coordinates main thread-worker communication, using `Transferable` objects (e.g., `ArrayBuffer`) for efficiency.
   - Manages worker pooling to minimize instantiation overhead.

## Integration Points
- **Particle Domain (`src/domains/creature/`)**: `particleService.ts` coordinates physics updates, providing `IParticle[]` data and receiving updated positions.
- **Formation Domain (`src/domains/traits/`)**: `formationService.ts` supplies `IFormationPattern` data for spring force calculations, ensuring particles adhere to patterns.
- **Rendering Domain (`src/domains/rendering/`)**: `instancedRenderer.ts` uses updated positions to render particles, maintaining visual coherence.
- **Game Theory Domain (`src/domains/gameTheory/`)**: `payoffMatrixService.ts` incorporates particle positions and movement (e.g., “Spiral Charge” damage boost) for battle outcomes.
- **Workers Domain (`src/domains/workers/`)**: `forceWorker.ts` and `positionWorker.ts` execute physics calculations, managed by `workerBridge.ts`.
- **Bitcoin Domain (`src/domains/bitcoin/`)**: Provides `IBlockData` for seeding RNG in dynamic force adjustments (e.g., randomized repulsion for MOVEMENT).

## Performance Goals
- **Update Time**: < 5ms for physics calculations (forces + positions) for 500 particles, ensuring 60 FPS.
- **FPS**: Maintain ≥ 60 FPS during particle rendering and physics updates.
- **CPU Usage**: < 15% CPU usage on mid-range devices for physics tasks.
- **Memory Usage**: < 10 MB for physics data (e.g., particle positions, force vectors).
- **Scalability**: Support up to 5,000 particles (10 creatures) with linear performance scaling.

## Rules Adherence
- **Determinism**: Physics calculations use static inputs (e.g., particle positions, formation patterns) or seeded RNG, ensuring consistent outcomes for the same block nonce [Timestamp: April 12, 2025, 12:18].
- **Modularity**: Physics logic is encapsulated in `forceWorker.ts` and `positionWorker.ts`, with clear interfaces via `workerBridge.ts`.
- **Performance**: Optimized with spatial partitioning, batch processing, and off-thread execution to meet real-time requirements [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].
- **Integration**: Seamlessly connects with formations, rendering, and game theory, supporting cohesive gameplay.

## Migration Steps
To transition from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main):
1. **Identify Existing Logic**: Locate physics-related code (e.g., in `src/creatures/` or `src/lib/`), likely scattered or implicit in particle management.
2. **Refactor into Workers**: Move force and position logic to `src/domains/workers/services/forceWorker.ts` and `positionWorker.ts`, ensuring off-thread execution.
3. **Integrate with Formations**: Update `formationService.ts` to provide pattern data for spring forces, aligning with formation documentation [Timestamp: April 8, 2025, 19:50].
4. **Optimize Performance**: Implement spatial partitioning in `spatialUtils.ts` and batch processing for efficiency.
5. **Test System**: Validate physics stability, determinism, and performance using Jest tests and Chrome DevTools profiling, targeting < 5ms updates.

## Example Integration
```typescript
// src/domains/creature/services/particleService.ts
import { workerBridge } from 'src/domains/workers/services/workerBridge';
import { formationService } from 'src/domains/traits/services/formationService';

class ParticleService {
  async updatePhysics(particles: IParticle[], deltaTime: number): Promise<IParticle[]> {
    const formationPatterns = formationService.getCurrentFormations(particles);
    const forces = await workerBridge.sendMessage('force', {
      task: 'calculateForces',
      data: { particles, formationPatterns, deltaTime }
    });
    const updatedParticles = await workerBridge.sendMessage('position', {
      task: 'updatePositions',
      data: { particles, forces, deltaTime }
    });
    logger.debug(`Physics update completed in ${performance.now() - start}ms`, { particleCount: particles.length });
    return updatedParticles;
  }
}

export const particleService = new ParticleService();
```
