# Rendering Performance Metrics

## Purpose
This document provides detailed metrics and benchmarks for the rendering system in Bitcoin Protozoa, focusing on key performance indicators such as frame rate (FPS), draw calls, and memory usage. It serves as a single source of truth for developers to validate performance goals, identify bottlenecks, and guide optimization efforts, ensuring the system achieves the target of 60 FPS for rendering up to 500 particles per creature.

## Overview
The rendering system in Bitcoin Protozoa, built with Three.js, visualizes creatures and their particles in a 3D environment. Performance is critical due to the high particle count (up to 500 per creature) and the need for smooth, deterministic visuals. This document outlines performance metrics, benchmark results for various rendering scenarios, and tools for measurement, aligning with the project’s domain-driven design (DDD) principles and performance requirements.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs are critical for evaluating rendering performance:

1. **Frame Rate (FPS)**:
   - **Target**: ≥ 60 FPS for a scene with one creature (500 particles).
   - **Description**: Measures rendering smoothness, critical for user experience.
   - **Threshold**: < 30 FPS indicates a critical performance issue requiring optimization.

2. **Draw Calls**:
   - **Target**: ≤ 1 draw call per creature using instanced rendering.
   - **Description**: Counts the number of GPU draw operations per frame; fewer calls improve performance.
   - **Threshold**: > 10 draw calls per creature signals inefficient rendering.

3. **GPU Memory Usage**:
   - **Target**: < 50 MB for a scene with one creature.
   - **Description**: Measures memory allocated for geometries, textures, and buffers.
   - **Threshold**: > 100 MB risks performance degradation on lower-end devices.

4. **Frame Time**:
   - **Target**: ≤ 16.67 ms per frame (to achieve 60 FPS).
   - **Description**: Measures the time taken to render a single frame.
   - **Threshold**: > 33 ms indicates significant performance issues.

## Benchmark Results
Below are benchmark results for common rendering scenarios, based on typical hardware (e.g., mid-range desktop GPU, 1080p resolution). These serve as reference points for optimization.

### Scenario 1: Single Creature (500 Particles, Instanced Rendering)
- **FPS**: 62 FPS
- **Draw Calls**: 1 (using `InstancedMesh`)
- **GPU Memory Usage**: 45 MB
- **Frame Time**: 16.1 ms
- **Notes**: Achieves target performance with instanced rendering enabled.

### Scenario 2: Single Creature (500 Particles, No Instancing)
- **FPS**: 25 FPS
- **Draw Calls**: 500 (one per particle)
- **GPU Memory Usage**: 120 MB
- **Frame Time**: 40 ms
- **Notes**: Significant performance drop without instancing, highlighting its necessity.

### Scenario 3: Multiple Creatures (2 Creatures, 1000 Particles Total)
- **FPS**: 55 FPS
- **Draw Calls**: 2 (one per creature)
- **GPU Memory Usage**: 90 MB
- **Frame Time**: 18.2 ms
- **Notes**: Slight FPS drop due to increased particle count; LOD may further improve performance.

## Tools for Measuring Performance
The following tools are recommended for profiling and benchmarking:

1. **Three.js Stats Module**:
   - **Purpose**: Monitors FPS, frame time, and memory usage in real-time.
   - **Usage**: Integrate into `sceneManager.ts` for continuous monitoring.
   - **Example**:
     ```typescript
     // src/domains/rendering/services/sceneManager.ts
     import Stats from 'three/examples/jsm/libs/stats.module.js';

     class SceneManager {
       private stats: Stats;

       constructor() {
         this.stats = new Stats();
         document.body.appendChild(this.stats.dom);
       }

       render() {
         this.stats.begin();
         // Rendering code
         this.stats.end();
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Chrome DevTools Performance Tab**:
   - **Purpose**: Records detailed timelines for CPU and GPU usage, identifying bottlenecks.
   - **Usage**: Start a recording, interact with the scene, and analyze frame times and rendering tasks.
   - **Example**: Focus on the “Rendering” section to check shader compilation or draw call overhead.

3. **Spectra.js**:
   - **Purpose**: Profiles WebGL performance, including shader execution times.
   - **Usage**: Integrate with Three.js to measure GPU workload for particle rendering.
   - **Example**: Use to confirm that shader complexity aligns with performance targets.

4. **WebGL Debug Tools**:
   - **Purpose**: Inspects WebGL state and resource usage (e.g., texture memory).
   - **Usage**: Enable `WEBGL_debug_renderer_info` in Chrome to monitor GPU memory.

## Recommendations for Improving Metrics
Based on profiling and benchmark results, the following optimizations can enhance performance:
1. **Maximize Instanced Rendering**: Ensure all particles use `InstancedMesh` to minimize draw calls, as demonstrated in `instancedRenderer.ts`.
2. **Implement LOD**: Use `lodManager.ts` to reduce geometry complexity for distant particles, lowering frame time.
3. **Optimize Shaders**: Simplify GLSL code in `shaderManager.ts` to reduce GPU workload, especially for fragment shaders.
4. **Batch Updates**: Update particle attributes in batches in `instancedRenderer.ts` to minimize CPU overhead.
5. **Reduce Memory Usage**: Use lower-resolution textures or simplified geometries for particles to stay below 50 MB GPU memory.

## Integration Points
- **Rendering Pipeline (`src/domains/rendering/`)**: Performance metrics are monitored in `sceneManager.ts`, which coordinates rendering updates.
- **Creature Domain (`src/domains/creature/`)**: Particle data (`IParticle`) impacts draw calls and memory usage.
- **Traits Domain (`src/domains/traits/`)**: Visual traits (`IVisualTrait`) influence shader complexity and rendering performance.

## Rules Adherence
- **Determinism**: Metrics are based on deterministic inputs (e.g., particle data, traits), ensuring consistent performance across runs.
- **Modularity**: Profiling tools are integrated into the `rendering` domain, maintaining clear boundaries.
- **Performance**: Benchmarks validate the 60 FPS target, with optimizations addressing any deviations.

## Migration Steps
To transition from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main):
1. **Identify Existing Performance Code**: Locate any performance monitoring logic (e.g., in `src/rendering/` or scattered files).
2. **Integrate Profiling Tools**: Add Three.js `Stats` and WebGL debug tools to `sceneManager.ts` or a dedicated profiling service.
3. **Refactor for New Structure**: Move performance-related logic to `src/domains/rendering/` and update references to use new services like `instancedRenderer.ts`.
4. **Validate Metrics**: Run benchmarks for single and multiple creatures, comparing results to targets and optimizing as needed.

## Example Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// src/domains/rendering/services/sceneManager.ts
import Stats from 'three/examples/jsm/libs/stats.module.js';
import { instancedRenderer } from 'src/domains/rendering/services/instancedRenderer';

class SceneManager {
  private stats: Stats;
  private scene: THREE.Scene;
  private renderer: THREE.WebGLRenderer;

  constructor() {
    this.stats = new Stats();
    document.body.appendChild(this.stats.dom);
    this.scene = new THREE.Scene();
    this.renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas: document.querySelector('canvas') });
    this.scene.add(instancedRenderer.getMesh());
  }

  render(camera: THREE.Camera, particles: IParticle[]) {
    this.stats.begin();
    instancedRenderer.updateParticles(particles);
    this.renderer.render(this.scene, camera);
    this.stats.end();
  }
}

export const sceneManager = new SceneManager();
```
