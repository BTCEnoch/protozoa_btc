# RNG Performance Optimization

## Purpose
This document outlines strategies for optimizing the performance of Bitcoin Protozoa’s Random Number Generation (RNG) system, ensuring efficient generation of deterministic pseudo-random numbers using the Mulberry32 algorithm to support real-time gameplay for creatures with up to 500 particles. It serves as a single source of truth for developers, tailored to the project’s particle-based design with role-specific mechanics (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK), extensive trait system, and new DDD framework, ensuring clarity during migration from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main).

## Common Performance Bottlenecks
The RNG system, implemented in `rngSystem.ts` and using the Mulberry32 algorithm seeded by the Bitcoin block nonce, can encounter several performance bottlenecks when generating random numbers for 500 particles across multiple streams (`traits`, `physics`, `formation`, `visual`, `subclass`, `ability`, `mutation`) [Timestamp: April 4, 2025, 14:16]:

1. **Frequent Stream Access**:
   - **Issue**: Rapid, repeated calls to stream methods (e.g., `next`, `nextInt`) for high-frequency tasks (e.g., 500 particle physics updates per frame) increase CPU usage.
   - **Impact**: Generation times exceed 1ms, risking FPS drops below 60 [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].
2. **Stream Initialization Overhead**:
   - **Issue**: Initializing multiple streams (e.g., for 10 creatures) with nonce-based seeding and API calls to `bitcoinService.ts` introduces latency.
   - **Impact**: Initialization times > 1ms delay creature generation or replay.
3. **Distribution Computation**:
   - **Issue**: Complex distributions (e.g., exponential for mutation timing) or frequent categorical selections (e.g., trait rarity) add computational overhead.
   - **Impact**: Distribution generation exceeds 0.1ms per call, accumulating for large particle counts.
4. **Storage I/O Overhead**:
   - **Issue**: Persisting nonce seeds and stream states via `StorageService.ts` for session replay incurs IndexedDB write costs [Timestamp: April 16, 2025, 21:41].
   - **Impact**: Write times > 1ms slow down initialization and replay.
5. **Main Thread Congestion**:
   - **Issue**: Excessive RNG calls on the main thread (e.g., for visualization effects) compete with rendering and input handling.
   - **Impact**: Causes stuttering or FPS drops below 60 [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].

## Optimization Techniques
To mitigate these bottlenecks, the following techniques are recommended, tailored to Bitcoin Protozoa’s design and performance goals [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58; April 4, 2025, 14:16]:

### 1. Batch Random Number Generation
- **Technique**: Generate multiple random numbers in a single call for high-frequency tasks (e.g., 500 particle attributes), reducing per-call overhead.
- **Implementation**: Add a `nextBatch` method to `RNGStreamImpl` to produce an array of random numbers, leveraging Mulberry32’s efficiency.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/shared/interfaces/rngStream.ts
  class RNGStreamImpl implements RNGStream {
    nextBatch(count: number): number[] {
      const result = new Array(count);
      for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        result[i] = this.rng();
      }
      return result;
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Lazy Stream Initialization
- **Technique**: Initialize streams only when first accessed, avoiding upfront costs for unused streams (e.g., `formation` for a creature without formations) [Timestamp: April 4, 2025, 14:16].
- **Implementation**: Defer stream creation in `rngSystem.ts` until `getStream` is called, checking `seedCache` for existing seeds.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/shared/services/rngSystem.ts
  getStream(name: string): RNGStream {
    if (!this.streams.has(name)) {
      const seed = Math.floor(this.mainRNG() * 4294967296);
      this.createStream(name, seed);
      logger.debug(`Lazily initialized stream ${name} with seed ${seed}`);
    }
    return this.streams.get(name)!;
  }
  ```

### 3. Seed and State Caching
- **Technique**: Cache nonce seeds and stream states in memory (`seedCache`) and persist them efficiently via `StorageService.ts` to minimize API calls and I/O [Timestamp: April 16, 2025, 21:41].
- **Implementation**: Store seeds in IndexedDB only during initialization or replay, using batch writes for multiple creatures.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/shared/services/rngSystem.ts
  async initializeStream(streamId: string, blockData?: IBlockData): Promise<void> {
    if (this.seedCache[streamId]) return;
    const data = blockData || await bitcoinService.fetchLatestBlock();
    const seed = data.nonce;
    this.seedCache[streamId] = seed;
    await StorageService.save('rngState', streamId, { streamId, seed, blockHeight: data.height });
  }
  ```

### 4. Optimized Distribution Calculations
- **Technique**: Precompute or cache distribution parameters (e.g., trait rarity thresholds, exponential rates) to reduce computation in `nextBool`, `nextItem`, etc.
- **Implementation**: Store static distribution data (e.g., `rarityThresholds`) in a lookup table within `RNGStreamImpl`.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/shared/interfaces/rngStream.ts
  class RNGStreamImpl implements RNGStream {
    private rarityThresholds = {
      COMMON: 0.4,
      UNCOMMON: 0.7,
      RARE: 0.9,
      EPIC: 0.98,
      LEGENDARY: 0.995,
      MYTHIC: 1.0
    };

    nextItem<T>(array: T[]): T {
      if (array.length === 0) throw new Error('Empty array');
      const random = this.next();
      // Example: Simplified rarity selection
      if (array === availableTraits) {
        if (random < this.rarityThresholds.COMMON) return array[0];
        if (random < this.rarityThresholds.RARE) return array[1];
        return array[2];
      }
      return array[this.nextInt(0, array.length - 1)];
    }
  }
  ```

### 5. Off-Thread RNG Processing
- **Technique**: Offload intensive RNG tasks (e.g., batch mutation triggers for 10 creatures) to `computeWorker.ts` to avoid main thread congestion [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].
- **Implementation**: Use `workerBridge.ts` to dispatch RNG tasks, transferring nonce seeds and stream data as `Transferable` objects.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/mutation/services/mutationService.ts
  async triggerBatchMutations(creatures: ICreature[], blockData: IBlockData): Promise<IMutation[]> {
    const streamId = `batch_mutation_${blockData.height}`;
    await rngSystem.initializeStream(streamId, blockData);
    const mutationRNG = rngSystem.getStream('mutation');
    const taskData = { streamId, creatures, confirmations: blockData.confirmations };
    const results = await workerBridge.sendMessage('compute', {
      task: 'batchMutations',
      data: taskData
    });
    return results;
  }
  ```

## Performance Metrics

// src/domains/creature/services/particleService.ts
async updatePhysics(particles: IParticle[], deltaTime: number): Promise<IParticle[]> {
  const physicsRNG = rngSystem.getStream('physics');
  const start = performance.now();
  // Batch generate random force adjustments
  const adjustments = physicsRNG.nextBatch(particles.length);
  particles.forEach((p, i) => {
    p.forceAdjustment = adjustments[i] * 0.1; // Example scaling
  });
  logger.debug(`Physics RNG batch for ${particles.length} particles: ${performance.now() - start}ms`);
