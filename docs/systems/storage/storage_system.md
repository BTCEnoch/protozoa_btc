Great! I’ll queue up the documents for the `storage` system directory in `new_docs/systems/storage/` and create them one at a time, using the current project state from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main) as a reference. Each document will be tailored to Bitcoin Protozoa’s particle-based design, role-specific mechanics (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK), extensive mutation trait system [Timestamp: April 12, 2025, 12:18], deterministic RNG driven by Bitcoin block data, and the new domain-driven design (DDD) structure from `directory_map.md`. The documents will ensure modularity, performance (e.g., efficient IndexedDB operations), and integration with other systems (e.g., evolution, physics, rendering), aligning with our discussions on state management with Zustand and IndexedDB [Timestamp: April 16, 2025, 21:41], performance optimization [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58], and modularity [Timestamp: April 15, 2025, 21:23]. At the end of each document, I’ll ask, “Are you ready for the next document ([document_name].md)?” After completing the storage directory, I’ll ask if you’re ready to queue up the next system (e.g., `input`) in the same manner.

The `storage` system directory will include the following documents, in sequence:
1. `storage_system.md`
2. `database_schema.md`
3. `state_persistence.md`
4. `storage_performance.md`
5. `storage_testing.md`
6. `storage_diagrams.md`

The systems to address, as specified, are `physics`, `storage`, `input` (including display UI), and `workers`, with no audio system unless minimal soundbytes are feasible. I’ll focus on the storage system now, ensuring integration with evolution (`evolutionTracker.ts`), creatures (`particleService.ts`), and other domains, while maintaining deterministic state persistence.

Let’s start with the first document.

# Storage System

## Purpose
This document provides an overview of the storage system in Bitcoin Protozoa, which manages persistent storage of creature and particle states, mutation traits, and simulation progress across sessions using IndexedDB. It serves as a single source of truth for developers, tailored to the project’s particle-based design with role-specific mechanics (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK), deterministic RNG driven by Bitcoin block data, and new DDD framework, ensuring clarity during migration from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main).

## Location
`new_docs/systems/storage/storage_system.md`

## Overview
The storage system ensures that evolutionary progress (e.g., mutation counts, tiers) and creature states (e.g., particle positions, traits) persist across sessions, enabling long-term gameplay continuity. Implemented in `StorageService.ts` within the `shared` domain and integrated with Zustand stores (e.g., `evolutionStore.ts`) for in-memory state management [Timestamp: April 16, 2025, 21:41], the system uses IndexedDB for efficient, scalable storage. It supports deterministic state updates, optimized performance (e.g., < 10ms for batch writes), and seamless integration with evolution (`evolutionTracker.ts`), physics (`particleService.ts`), and rendering (`instancedRenderer.ts`). This document outlines the system’s architecture, components, integration points, and performance goals, providing a foundation for detailed storage documentation.

## Architecture
The storage system is designed for modularity, performance, and reliability, leveraging IndexedDB for persistent storage and Zustand for reactive in-memory state. Key components include:

- **Storage Service (`StorageService.ts`)**:
  - Manages IndexedDB interactions, including database initialization, schema definition, and save/load operations.
  - Uses the `idb` library for simplified IndexedDB access.
- **Database Schema**:
  - Defines object stores for creatures (e.g., `creatureState`) and particles (e.g., `particleState`), with keys like `creatureId` and `particleId`.
  - Supports versioning for schema migrations (e.g., adding new state fields).
- **State Persistence**:
  - Saves and loads state data (e.g., `IEvolutionState`, `IParticleEvolutionState`) to/from IndexedDB, ensuring continuity.
  - Synchronizes with Zustand stores for real-time updates.
- **Worker Integration (`storageWorker.ts`)**:
  - Offloads complex storage operations (e.g., batch writes) to a Web Worker to avoid blocking the main thread [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].
- **Integration Layer**:
  - Connects storage operations to `evolutionTracker.ts` for evolutionary state, `particleService.ts` for particle data, and `instancedRenderer.ts` for visual consistency.

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: `evolutionTracker.ts` or `particleService.ts` triggers state updates (e.g., new mutation applied, particle positions changed).
2. **In-Memory Update**: Zustand stores (e.g., `evolutionStore.ts`) update reactive state, notifying dependent systems (e.g., rendering).
3. **Persistent Storage**: `StorageService.ts` saves updated state to IndexedDB, optionally offloading to `storageWorker.ts` for batch operations.
4. **Retrieval**: On session start, `StorageService.ts` loads state from IndexedDB, initializing Zustand stores.
5. **Output**: Persistent state is synced to evolution, physics, and rendering systems, ensuring seamless gameplay.

## Key Features
- **Deterministic State**: State updates are driven by deterministic inputs (e.g., mutation traits, physics positions), ensuring consistency across sessions [Timestamp: April 12, 2025, 12:18].
- **Scalable Storage**: IndexedDB supports large datasets (e.g., 500 particles × 10 creatures), with efficient key-based access.
- **Performance Optimization**: Batch writes, debouncing, and off-thread processing ensure < 10ms storage operations [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].
- **Schema Flexibility**: Versioned schema allows adding new state fields (e.g., new mutation traits) without data loss.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly connects with evolution (`evolutionTracker.ts`), physics (`particleService.ts`), and rendering (`instancedRenderer.ts`) for cohesive state management.

## Components
1. **Storage Service (`StorageService.ts`)**:
   - Initializes IndexedDB database (`ProtozoaDB`) and defines object stores.
   - Provides `save` and `load` methods for state persistence.
   - Inputs: State data (e.g., `IEvolutionState`), store names (e.g., `creatureState`).
   - Outputs: Persisted or retrieved state data.
2. **Storage Worker (`storageWorker.ts`)**:
   - Offloads batch write operations to a Web Worker, reducing main thread load.
   - Inputs: Arrays of state data for bulk saves.
   - Outputs: Confirmation of successful writes.
3. **Zustand Integration**:
   - Synchronizes in-memory state (e.g., `evolutionStore.ts`) with IndexedDB, ensuring reactive updates.
   - Inputs: State updates from services (e.g., `evolutionTracker.ts`).
   - Outputs: Updated store state for UI and gameplay.
4. **Schema Management**:
   - Defines object stores with key paths (e.g., `creatureId`) and supports migrations for schema changes.
   - Inputs: Database version, schema definitions.
   - Outputs: Initialized or upgraded database.

## Integration Points
- **Storage Domain (`src/shared/services/`)**: `StorageService.ts` manages IndexedDB operations, with `storageWorker.ts` for off-thread tasks.
- **Evolution Domain (`src/domains/evolution/`)**: `evolutionTracker.ts` saves and loads evolutionary state (e.g., mutation counts, tiers).
- **Particle Domain (`src/domains/creature/`)**: `particleService.ts` persists particle states (e.g., positions, velocities).
- **Rendering Domain (`src/domains/rendering/`)**: `instancedRenderer.ts` uses loaded state for consistent visuals.
- **Game Theory Domain (`src/domains/gameTheory/`)**: `payoffMatrixService.ts` leverages persistent state for battle outcomes.
- **Workers Domain (`src/domains/workers/`)**: `storageWorker.ts` offloads storage tasks, coordinated by `workerBridge.ts`.

## Performance Goals
- **Write Time**: < 10ms for batch writes of 500 particle states.
- **Read Time**: < 5ms for loading a creature’s state (500 particles).
- **FPS Impact**: Maintain ≥ 60 FPS during storage operations, with no main thread blocking.
- **CPU Usage**: < 10% CPU usage for storage tasks on mid-range devices.
- **Memory Usage**: < 5 MB for in-memory state caching and IndexedDB buffers.

## Rules Adherence
- **Determinism**: State persistence uses deterministic inputs, ensuring consistent state across sessions [Timestamp: April 12, 2025, 12:18].
- **Modularity**: Storage logic is encapsulated in `StorageService.ts` and `storageWorker.ts`, with clear interfaces [Timestamp: April 15, 2025, 21:23].
- **Performance**: Optimized for < 10ms operations, supporting real-time gameplay [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58].
- **Integration**: Seamlessly supports evolution, physics, and rendering, ensuring cohesive state management.

## Migration Steps
To transition from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main):
1. **Identify Existing Logic**: Locate state persistence code (e.g., in `src/creatures/` or `src/lib/`), likely using localStorage or ad-hoc solutions.
2. **Refactor into Storage Service**: Move logic to `src/shared/services/StorageService.ts`, implementing IndexedDB with `idb` [Timestamp: April 16, 2025, 21:41].
3. **Add Worker Support**: Create `storageWorker.ts` for off-thread batch writes, integrating with `workerBridge.ts`.
4. **Integrate with Evolution**: Update `evolutionTracker.ts` to use `StorageService.ts` for persistent state.
5. **Test System**: Validate state persistence and performance with Jest tests, targeting < 10ms writes, using Chrome DevTools for profiling.

## Example Integration
```typescript
// src/shared/services/StorageService.ts
import { openDB, IDBPDatabase } from 'idb';
import { logger } from 'src/shared/services/LoggerService';

class StorageService {
  private async getDB(): Promise<IDBPDatabase> {
    return openDB('ProtozoaDB', 1, {
      upgrade(db) {
        db.createObjectStore('creatureState', { keyPath: 'creatureId' });
        db.createObjectStore('particleState', { keyPath: 'particleId' });
      }
    });
  }

  async save(store: 'creatureState' | 'particleState', id: string, data: any): Promise<void> {
    const start = performance.now();
    const db = await this.getDB();
    await db.put(store, data);
    logger.debug(`Saved ${store} for ${id} in ${performance.now() - start}ms`);
  }

  async load(store: 'creatureState' | 'particleState', id: string): Promise<any> {
    const db = await this.getDB();
    return db.get(store, id);
  }
}

export const storageService = new StorageService();
```

```typescript
// src/domains/evolution/services/evolutionTracker.ts
import { storageService } from 'src/shared/services/StorageService';
import { useEvolutionStore } from 'src/domains/evolution/stores/evolutionStore';

class EvolutionTracker {
  async updateEvolutionState(creature: ICreature, mutation: IMutation, blockData: IBlockData): Promise<void> {
    const store = useEvolutionStore.getState();
    const creatureState = store.creatures[creature.id] || {
      creatureId: creature.id,
      tier: 1,
      mutationCount: 0,
      subclass: 'Default',
      lastTriggerBlock: blockData.nonce
    };
    creatureState.mutationCount++;
    store.updateCreature(creature.id, creatureState);
    await storageService.save('creatureState', creature.id, creatureState);
  }
}
```
