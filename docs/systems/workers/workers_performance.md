# Workers Performance Optimization

## Purpose
This document outlines strategies for optimizing the performance of Bitcoin Protozoa’s workers system, ensuring efficient task execution and data transfer in Web Workers to maintain 60 FPS and minimal main thread impact for creatures with up to 500 particles. It serves as a single source of truth for developers, tailored to the project’s particle-based design with role-specific mechanics (CORE, CONTROL, MOVEMENT, DEFENSE, ATTACK), deterministic RNG driven by Bitcoin block data, and new DDD framework, ensuring clarity during migration from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main).

## Common Performance Bottlenecks
The workers system, managing off-thread tasks via `workerBridge.ts` and workers like `forceWorker.ts`, `computeWorker.ts`, and `storageWorker.ts`, can encounter several performance bottlenecks when handling 500 particles:

1. **High Worker Execution Time**:
   - **Issue**: Complex tasks (e.g., physics force calculations, game theory simulations) take > 5ms, delaying result delivery.
   - **Impact**: Slows system updates, risking FPS drops below 60.
2. **Data Transfer Overhead**:
   - **Issue**: Large datasets (e.g., 500 particles’ positions) incur high serialization or copying costs if not using `Transferable` objects.
   - **Impact**: Transfer times exceed 1ms, adding latency to task cycles.
3. **Worker Instantiation Overhead**:
   - **Issue**: Creating new workers (e.g., ~10ms per worker) for frequent tasks increases latency.
   - **Impact**: Delays task dispatching, impacting main thread responsiveness.
4. **Main Thread Congestion**:
   - **Issue**: Excessive task dispatching or result handling on the main thread competes with rendering and UI updates.
   - **Impact**: Causes stuttering or dropped frames, degrading user experience.
5. **Resource Overuse**:
   - **Issue**: Too many active workers or unoptimized memory usage strain CPU and memory resources.
   - **Impact**: Reduces performance on mid-range devices, risking FPS below 60.

## Optimization Techniques
To mitigate these bottlenecks, the following techniques are recommended, tailored to Bitcoin Protozoa’s design and performance goals [Timestamp: April 14, 2025, 19:58]:

### 1. Efficient Task Execution
- **Technique**: Optimize worker task logic to reduce computation time, using techniques like spatial partitioning for physics or caching for game theory.
- **Implementation**: In `forceWorker.ts`, use `spatialUtils.ts` to limit force calculations to nearby particles, reducing complexity from O(n²) to O(n) [Timestamp: April 8, 2025, 19:50].
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/workers/services/forceWorker.ts
  function calculateForces(particles: IParticle[], patterns: { [role: string]: IFormationPattern }, deltaTime: number): Float32Array {
    const forces = new Float32Array(particles.length * 3);
    const grid = spatialUtils.createGrid(particles, 5); // 5-unit cells
    particles.forEach((p, i) => {
      const force = new THREE.Vector3();
      const cellKey = spatialUtils.getCellKey(p.position, 5);
      const neighbors = grid.get(cellKey) || [];
      neighbors.forEach(n => {
        if (n !== p && distance(p.position, n.position) < 2) {
          force.add(calculateRepulsion(p, n));
        }
      });
      forces[i * 3] = force.x;
      forces[i * 3 + 1] = force.y;
      forces[i * 3 + 2] = force.z;
    });
    return forces;
  }
  ```

### 2. Optimized Data Transfer
- **Technique**: Use `Transferable` objects (e.g., `Float32Array`, `ArrayBuffer`) for large datasets to eliminate copying, minimizing transfer latency.
- **Implementation**: In `workerBridge.ts`, transfer typed arrays for particle data and results, reducing transfer time by ~50% for 500 particles.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/workers/services/workerBridge.ts
  async sendMessage(workerType: string, data: any): Promise<any> {
    const worker = this.getWorker(workerType);
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      worker.onmessage = (e: MessageEvent) => {
        resolve(e.data);
      };
      worker.onerror = (e: ErrorEvent) => reject(e);
      worker.postMessage(data, [data.buffer].filter(Boolean)); // Transfer ArrayBuffer
    });
  }
  ```

### 3. Worker Pooling
- **Technique**: Reuse workers via a pool in `workerBridge.ts` to avoid instantiation overhead (~10ms per worker).
- **Implementation**: Maintain up to 4 workers per type, reusing idle workers and terminating inactive ones after 60s.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/workers/services/workerBridge.ts
  private getWorker(workerType: string): Worker {
    if (!this.workerPool[workerType]) this.workerPool[workerType] = [];
    let worker = this.workerPool[workerType].pop();
    if (!worker && this.workerPool[workerType].length < this.MAX_WORKERS) {
      worker = new Worker(new URL(`./${workerType}Worker.ts`, import.meta.url));
    }
    return worker || this.workerPool[workerType][0]; // Reuse oldest worker
  }
  ```

### 4. Task Throttling
- **Technique**: Throttle task dispatching to avoid overwhelming workers or the main thread, especially for rapid inputs (e.g., battle triggers).
- **Implementation**: Implement debouncing in `inputService.ts` or batching in `particleService.ts` to consolidate tasks.
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/creature/services/particleService.ts
  private lastUpdate = 0;
  async updatePhysics(particles: IParticle[], deltaTime: number): Promise<IParticle[]> {
    const now = performance.now();
    if (now - this.lastUpdate < 16) { // ~60 FPS
      logger.debug('Throttled physics update');
      return particles;
    }
    this.lastUpdate = now;
    const forces = await workerBridge.sendMessage('force', { task: 'calculateForces', data: { particles, formationPatterns: {}, deltaTime } });
    return await workerBridge.sendMessage('position', { task: 'updatePositions', data: { particles, forces, deltaTime } });
  }
  ```

### 5. Resource Management
- **Technique**: Limit active workers and optimize memory usage to prevent CPU/memory strain on mid-range devices.
- **Implementation**: Cap worker pools at 4 per type, terminate idle workers after 60s, and use compact data structures (e.g., `Float32Array`).
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // src/domains/workers/services/workerBridge.ts
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (!this.workerPool[workerType].includes(worker)) {
      worker.terminate();
      logger.debug(`Terminated idle ${workerType} worker`);
    }
  }, this.IDLE_TIMEOUT); // 60s
  ```

## Migration Steps
To transition from the current GitHub structure (https://github.com/BTCEnoch/Protozoa/tree/main):
1. **Identify Existing Logic**: Locate main-thread computations (e.g., in `src/creatures/` or `src/lib/`), likely causing bottlenecks.
2. **Refactor into Workers**: Optimize task logic in `forceWorker.ts`, `computeWorker.ts`, and `storageWorker.ts` with partitioning and caching.
3. **Enhance Worker Bridge**: Update `workerBridge.ts` with pooling and throttling for efficient task management.
4. **Integrate with Systems**: Ensure services use optimized workers for tasks, updating `eventBus.ts` for result handling.
5. **Test Performance**: Measure task execution, transfer times, and FPS with Jest and Chrome DevTools, targeting < 5ms tasks and 60 FPS.

## Example Optimization
```typescript
// src/domains/workers/services/computeWorker.ts
self.onmessage = function (e: MessageEvent) {
  const { task, data } = e.data;
  if (task === 'simulateBattle') {
    const result = simulateBattle(data.creatureIds);
    postMessage(result); // Small JSON payload
  }
};

function simulateBattle(creatureIds: string[]): { winner: string, scores: { [id: string]: number } } {
  // Simplified simulation with cached matrix
  const cachedMatrix = getCachedPayoffMatrix(creatureIds);
  const scores = { [creatureIds[0]]: cachedMatrix[0][0][0], [creatureIds[1]]: cachedMatrix[0][0][1] };
  return { winner: scores[creatureIds[0]] > scores[creatureIds[1]] ? creatureIds[0] : creatureIds[1], scores };
}
```
